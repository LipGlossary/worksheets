[Right-click and "Save link as..." to download this worksheet.](worksheets/sublime-text-2-package-control.md)

The real power of Sublime Text 2 lies in its abiility to install packages that can add complex behavior. What if there's a language you want to code in but there's no syntax highlighting available for it? There's a package for that. What if you want to preview some markup in the browser? There's a package for that. What if you want some fancier tab completion for JQuery? There's a package for that.

What if you want to search for and install packages from inside Sublime? There's a package for that.

Go to [packagecontrol.io/](https://packagecontrol.io/) and figure out how to install the Package Control package in Sublime.
