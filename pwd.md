# pwd

Just for fun, let's open the default Terminal that was installed on your Mac.

## The Prompt

When you open your terminal you're confronted with a prompt. Type that prompt
here:

<!-- Replace this comment with your answer -->

What are the pieces of your prompt and what do they mean?

<!-- Replace this comment with your anwer -->

You can close Terminal and go back to iTerm2. Isn't OhMyZsh's minimal prompt
nice? ;)

In these worksheets we will show the prompt as `$`. You may or may not have a
dollar sign in your prompt, but that doesn't matter--this is just a convention.
When we show a prompt and some stuff to type afterward, you don't have to type
the prompt itself.

## Commands

The prompt is prompting you to give it commands. So let's give it one.

    $ pwd

The terminal should say something in response. Type that response here:

<!-- Replace this comment with your answer -->

What does this response mean?

<!-- Replace this comment with your answer -->

So what does `pwd` do? What does `pwd` stand for? (It's an acronym.)
