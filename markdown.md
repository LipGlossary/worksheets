# Worksheet: Markdown

**Markdown** is a markup language (confusing, I know) meant to make formatting
text super easy to read, easy to write, and easy to share.

When you write with a word processor and format your text, under the hood code
is being generated that will render the text into the formatting you see on the
screen. Problems occur when you want to convert text formatted in one program
into another program because they use different formatting languages! Markup
languages are special because they are formatting codes written by a human, not
a word processor. While this may sound like more work for you, it's actually
less work in the long run, because

1.  You have complete control over what's going on "under the hood."
2.  The same markup language can be rendered by many different compilers.
3.  One markup language can (usually) be transpiled into a different one.
4.  In transfering marked-up text to another program, system, or person,
    everything will remain identical and your formatting will stay intact.

So you actually get to save time reformatting things, and you can be sure that
what you see is what other people see.

Markdown does its best to make writing markup in your text simple and easy. It's
other goal is to make your markup easy to read, even before it's been rendered.
If you're reading this document in Sublime Text, it should look pretty
understandable. That's because it's written in Markdown!

Did you know?: most wikis use markup instead of rich text editing. If you've
ever edited Wikipedia, you've already encountered a different kind of markup
specific to the MediaWiki software. GitHub's wikis use Markdwon, and if you
write a README in Markdown, it will automatically render on your repository's
home page.

So lets learn Markdown!

## Install a Markdown previewer package for Sublime

Skip this section if you've already installed Markdown Preview.

Before you begin, make sure you have the [Package Control package installed in Sublime](sublime-text-2-package-control).

### Open the Sublime Command Palette

Use `⌘⇧P` (`COMMAND-SHIFT-P`) to bring up the Command Palette.

## Learn how to use Markdown

As a developer, you're going to spend a lot of time searching the Internet for
pieces of knowledge to add to your mental toolbox. (That may not sound like fun,
but it sure beats going to the library or calling a professor!) Let's get used
to doing our own research right now. Open up Chrome and try to find some
resources to teach yourself Markdown.

Don't know where to start? Daring Fireball is the guy who's most "in charge" of
Markdown's development and maintenance. Use Google to find some of his
documentation.

### Figure out how to do all these block-level things in Markdown.

4. An ordered list:  

5. A multiple-line list item:  

6. A code block showing off some HTML code:

7. A nested blockquote:  

8. A horizontal rule:

### Figure out how to do all these inline things in Markdown.

1. A link...  

    1. "Automatically," such as an e-mail address:  

    2. With link text:  

    3. A reference-style link in a paragraph:

        Why are reference-style links awesome?

2. Emphasis (two ways):  

3. Strong emphasis (two ways):  

3. A literal asterisk or underscore:  

4. Inline code:  

5. An image...

    1. Inline...  

        1. Without alt text.  

        2. With alt text.  

    2. Reference-style...  

        1. Without alt text.  

        2. With alt text.

### Can you mix and match Markdown markup and HTML markup?

If so, give an example. If not, why not? (If you don't know anything about HTML,
that's okay. Just do your best to answer.)
